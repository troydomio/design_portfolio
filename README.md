# Personal Portfolio (version 2)

This project is a multi-component React application styled with css. 

## Component Hierarchy!
Upon breaking down my low-fidelity mockup from Figma, 3 main component categories emerged. I created sub-components for each category (some of them are re-usable)

## I Can't Start Coding Until I Know...
- How can I deploy my React app with multiple routes?
- What dimensions should I use for my media queries to follow 'mobile-first' styling best practices?
- How can I create and implement a hamburger menu?
- Am I going to hard code or create  database for the page content?
